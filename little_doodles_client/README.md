# LittleDoodles Godot Client Implementation

This implementation contains both the `LittleDoodlesClient` node for managing
server interactions as well as the `LittleDoodlesEntity` resource for
representing data from and transmitting data to the server. Each is fully
documented and can be referenced from within Godot via the "Search Help" feature.
