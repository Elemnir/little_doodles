# LittleDoodles Entity Cards Example

This is a simple Godot project that allows you to play with the LittleDoodles
Entity API through a simple graphical interface. Make sure you have the server
running somewhere, then just load `example.tscn`, update the `domain` of the 
LittleDoodlesClient node within the scene to point to your server, and run!

Simple feedback is provided in the UI, but detailed error messages will be
printed to the Godot debugger. Make sure you create or authenticate a user
before attempting to search for or save Entities!
